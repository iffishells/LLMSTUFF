Once you understand the diﬀerence, concentrate\\\\nyour eﬀorts on buying income-generating assets. That’s the\\\\nbest way to get started on a path to becoming rich. Keep\\\\ndoing that, and your asset column will grow. Keep liabilities\\\\nand expenses down so more money is available to continue\\\\npouring into the asset column. Soon the asset base will be\\\\nso deep that you can aﬀord to look at more speculative\\\\ninvestments: investments that may have returns of 100\\\\npercent to inﬁnity; $5,000 investments that are soon turned\\\\ninto $1 million or more; investments that the middle class\\\\ncalls “too risky.” The investment is not risky for the\\\\nﬁnancially literate.\\\\nIf you do what the masses do, you get the following\\\\npicture:\\'), Document(metadata={\\'source\\': \\'BooksBuckets/Rich Dad Poor Dad.pdf\\', \\'file_path\\': \\'BooksBuckets/Rich Dad Poor Dad.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 83, \\'total_pages\\': 253, \\'format\\': \\'PDF 1.4\\', \\'title\\': \\'Rich Dad Poor Dad\\', \\'author\\': \\'Robert T.

If you\\\\ndraw the boat card and it puts you into debt, the question\\\\nis: “Now what can you do?
